            <li>Analysis and disclosure of anonymized statistical data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Management</h2>
        <p>The app uses Google Firebase (hereinafter "Firebase") for storing and managing collected data. Firebase is a secure cloud-based platform provided by Google. Please note the following points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is stored on Firebase servers and is encrypted.</li>
            <li>We follow Firebase's security measures to prevent unauthorized access to data.</li>
            <li>The location of data storage depends on Firebase server locations, which may be outside your country.</li>
            <li>Firebase's privacy policy and Google's data processing terms apply.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While the use of Firebase allows the app to provide a more secure and efficient service, please understand that Google is involved in data management.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>The developer implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the collected information. This includes the use of Firebase's security features. Data is anonymized and stored in an encrypted state. However, as internet-based data transmission and electronic storage methods are not 100% secure, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>This app is a decision-making support tool, and the final judgment should be made at the user's own responsibility.</p>
        <p>Please note that the developer and operator cannot be held responsible for any damages or disadvantages resulting from the use of this app.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Advertising</h2>
        <p>The app displays advertisements. We use Google AdMob for ad delivery, which may use anonymous advertising IDs. The collection and use of data related to advertising comply with Google's advertising policies.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>The developer may update this privacy policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will notify you through the app and provide the latest information on this page. In case of significant changes, we may seek your consent again.</p>
